For this specific project, you'll be doing local development work with a local instance of supabase. This will help you to develop faster and iterate better.

1. Install all the packages. We're using yarn so make sure not to use `npm`

```
yarn install
```

2. Generate an .env.example file which will have all the necessary environment variables populated within it. Once you've populated it with the right variables, change it to `.env `

```
yarn run generate-env
```

3. Make sure that your database types are accurate. To do so, you'll need a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to be able to allow keysely to connect and introspect the prod db.

```
yarn run db-codegen
```

4. Login to supabase. You'll need to generate an access token for your local supabase instance. You can do so by going to [supabase's dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/account/tokens).

```
supabase login
```

5. Now you want to start a local development instance of supabase. You can do by running the command with

```
supabase start
```

This will in turn result in the following output

```
  schulz git:(main) âœ— supabase start

# Guides

## Planetscale Database Migration

We are experimenting with planetscale for now. Here is a guide as to how to work with planetscale.

1. Create a new branch

```
pscale branch create schulz <newBranch>
```

2. Connect to the new branch

```
pscale connect schulz <newBranch> --port 3309
```

3. Update `prisma.schema` and then push to new branch. Make sure to set the database url to `mysql://root@127.0.0.1:3309/schulz` so that you connect to the schula instance you're tunelling to locally

```
npx prisma db push
```

4. Create a deploy request

```
pscale deploy-request create schulz <newBranchName>
```
